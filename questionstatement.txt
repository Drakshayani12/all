3. Task Management Console Application
You are developing a console-based Java application to assist users in managing their tasks. The application should provide a text-based menu to the user and perform different types of task management operations based on the user's choice.
Here are the functionalities the application should provide:
Case1: Display a list of all tasks along with their details, such as task name, due date, and status.
Case2: Prompt the user to enter details for a new task, including the task name, due date, and status. Add the task to the task list.
Case3:Given a task name, update its status (e.g., from "To Do" to "Completed").
Case4:Given a task name, remove the task from the task list.
Case5:The user should be able to exit the application.
The main method should display a menu to the user with the above options, and depending on the user's choice, call the respective functionality.
Console Interaction:
At startup, the program should print the menu of operations.
After each operation, the menu should be displayed again, giving the user the ability to choose the next operation or exit.
If the user selects an option from 1 to 4, prompt the user for additional input (e.g., task details, task name) and display the result.
If the user selects option 5, print the message "Goodbye!" and exit the application.
If the user selects a choice other than the five choices given, provide the message "Invalid choice. Please select a valid option." to the user. Ensure that any input errors are handled gracefully with appropriate feedback to the user.
