4. Library System Console Application
You are tasked with developing a console-based Java application for a library system. The program should demonstrate the use of access specifiers (public, private, and protected) to protect data and methods.
1.LibraryBook Class:
• Create a LibraryBook class with the following fields and methods:
• bookTitle: A private field of type String.
• author: A private field of type String.
• numPages: A private field of type int.
• borrowed: A private field of type boolean, indicating whether the book is currently borrowed.
• displayBookInfo(): A public method that prints the book title, author, number of pages, and whether it is borrowed.
• borrowBook(): A public method that sets the borrowed field to true.
• returnBook(): A public method that sets the borrowed field to false.
2 LibraryMember Class:
• Create a LibraryMember class with the following fields and methods:
• memberName: A private field of type String.
• booksBorrowed: A private field representing the number of books currently borrowed by the member.
• maxBooksAllowed: A protected constant representing the maximum number of books a member can borrow.
• displayMemberInfo(): A public method that prints the member's name and the number of books borrowed.
• borrowBook(LibraryBook book): A public method that allows a member to borrow a book if they haven't reached the maximum limit.
• returnBook(LibraryBook book): A public method that allows a member to return a book.
3. Main Method:
• In your main method, create instances of the LibraryBook and LibraryMember classes. Demonstrate borrowing and returning books, and display the information about books and members.
Your task is to complete the following files:
• ./src/main/java/LibrarySystemApp.java
• ./src/main/java/LibraryBook.java
• ./src/main/java/LibraryMember.java
Note:
• Name the fields and methods exactly as provided above.
• Define the maxBooksAllowed constant as a protected field in the LibraryMember class.
Sample output:-
